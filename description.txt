-=- Revive Mod -=-

This is a multiplayer mod that makes it possible to revive other players in servers.
Upon death, players will leave an aura where they died that others can enter in order to revive the player.
As a way to balance respawn chaining when fighting bosses, this mod disables regular respawning during boss fights, forcing remaining players to revive others.

Use the "Pause Respawn Timer" keybind (P by default) to give others more time to revive you.
Config options allow you to alter the balancing of this mod, such as how long it takes to revive others and the speed at which auras may move.
